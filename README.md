# Prediction-Model-using-Support-Vector-Machine-Classifier
In this Project we are building a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not. The Model is developed using Machine Learning Model: Support Vector Machine Classifier algorithm, leveraging Python and scikit-learn for implementation.
